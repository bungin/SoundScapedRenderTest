homepage: responsiveness on cards/media queries, remove placeholders, 
    style logout/login buttons

last.fm gets info, genius gets lyrics
both take info from searchbar

features:

database reqs:

frontend: mobile usage

mvp: BARE MIN: serve one song with lyrics, save song/url to DB. 
    better: able to serve random artist or plus lyric list for song.
            random from genre plus lyric list for song. 
            ability to save specific songs(?)

    pulling from genre feels like the way to go.



stretch goals: eventbrite api, scrolling lyrics timed to song,

db: user/pass, genre, songs, artists, albums
    Say we have multiple users, how do we structure the DB?
    What does a user need to have stored?:
        email, username, password, favorite artists?,- 
        individual songs?(seems redundant with the function of spotify),
